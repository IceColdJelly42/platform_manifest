Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Android, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/download/using-repo).


To initialize your local repository using the IceColdJelly42 trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/IceColdJelly42/platform_manifest.git -b jb-mr1


Then to sync up:

    repo sync


To build run this script:

    ./vendor/aokp/build.sh


HINT:
If you want to use newer and faster version of ccache, you need to:

    sudo apt-get install ccache

and than in your home folder in .bashrc file put this line:

    export CUSTOM_CCACHE_PATH=/usr/bin
